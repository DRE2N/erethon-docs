## Joining
_TO DO_

## The game type
Like all dungeons, bedwars maps require a lobby. Although you can change most settings as usual just like in quest, adventure or other dungeons, a default set of rules is provided by the bedwars [game type](game-types). Setting this is obligatory for bedwars because some specific behavior is hardcoded.

_TO DO: IMAGE_

## The game
Add a [start sign](signs#start) and a bed with an attached [bed sign](signs#bed) for each group. In both cases, the number (starting with 0!) in the second line determines the player's group.

You can use [BossShop signs](signs#bossshop) for shops and [drop signs](signs#drop) for currency resources.
