## Leveling System

The leveling system allows NPCs to have different stats and loot based on their level. When an NPC spawns, a level is randomly selected based on weights.
Alternatively , you can set a fixed level for the NPC using Spawners or QuestsXL.

```yaml
leveling:
  1:  # Level 1 configuration
    weight: 100
    # Weight for random selection. Higher = more common.
    # Example: If level 1 has weight 100 and level 2 has weight 50,
    # level 1 will spawn 66% of the time, level 2 33% of the time.
    
    attributes:
      # Attribute bonuses for this level
      0:
        id: "max_health"
        value: 100  # Exact value
      1:
        id: "attack_damage"
        min: 10  # Random value between min and max
        max: 15
    
    loot:
      # Level-specific loot (overrides base loot)
      xp:
        min: 10
        max: 20
        # Random XP between 10 and 20
      
      items:
        - "minecraft:iron_sword;100"
        - "minecraft:iron_ingot;50"
  
  5:  # Level 5 configuration
    weight: 50
    # Less common than level 1
    
    attributes:
      0:
        id: "max_health"
        min: 200
        max: 250
      1:
        id: "attack_damage"
        value: 25
      2:
        id: "movement_speed"
        value: 0.3
    
    loot:
      xp:
        value: 100
        # Fixed XP value
      
      items:
        - "minecraft:diamond_sword;100"
        - "minecraft:diamond;75"
        - "erethon:legendary_item;10"
  
  10:  # Level 10 configuration (boss level)
    weight: 10
    # Very rare spawn
    
    attributes:
      0:
        id: "max_health"
        value: 1000
      1:
        id: "attack_damage"
        value: 50
      2:
        id: "armor"
        value: 20
      3:
        id: "knockback_resistance"
        value: 1.0
    
    loot:
      xp:
        min: 500
        max: 1000
      
      items:
        - "erethon:boss_drop;100"
        - "minecraft:nether_star;50"
```

### How Leveling Works

1. **Random Selection**: When an NPC spawns, the system randomly selects a level based on weights
2. **Attribute Inheritance**: If an attribute is not defined at a specific level, it falls back to the highest configured level below it
3. **Loot Inheritance**: Loot uses the highest configured level at or below the target level

Example:
- Level 3 spawns but only levels 1, 5, and 10 are configured
- Health comes from level 1 (highest below 3 with health defined)
- Attack damage comes from level 1
- Loot comes from level 1

## Interaction

### Messages

```yaml
interaction:
  messages:
    # Messages displayed above the NPC
    - "Hello there!"
    - "How can I help you?"
    - "Welcome, traveler!"
  
  randomTalker: true
  # If true, randomly says one of the messages when players are nearby
  # Default: false
```

### Sounds

```yaml
interaction:
  sounds:
    attack: "minecraft:entity_wolf_howl"
    # Sound played when attacking
    
    ambient: "minecraft:entity_villager_ambient"
    # Sound played periodically
    
    shoot: "minecraft:entity_skeleton_shoot"
    # Sound played when shooting projectiles
    
    death: "minecraft:entity_zombie_death"
    # Sound played on death
    
    hurt: "minecraft:entity_player_hurt"
    # Sound played when taking damage
```

All sounds are optional. Use Minecraft sound IDs from the Bukkit Sound enum.

## Combat

### Team/Faction

```yaml
team: "Brotherhood"
# Optional. Faction name for team-based combat
# NPCs in the same team won't attack each other
```

### Home Location

```yaml
homeLocation:
  x: 100
  y: 64
  z: 200
  range: 32
  # NPC will try to stay within this range of the home location
  # Useful for guards or stationary NPCs.
  # NPCs spawned from a Spawner or QXL event will automatically set their home location to their spawn point.
```

---

## QXL Integration

Aether supports QuestsXL integration through the `qxl` section. This allows you to add QuestsXL actions and conditions to your NPCs.

```yaml
qxl:
  # Standard QuestsXL action/condition format
  # See QuestsXL documentation for available actions and conditions
  # https://erethon.de/docs/questsxl
  
  # Example actions:
  onDeathActions:
    - "give_item: item=diamond; amount=5"
  visibilityConditions:
    - "has_quest: quest=my_quest"
```
---

## AI Configuration

AI controls the NPC's behavior through goals and targets.

```yaml
ai:
  goals:
    # Goals define what actions the NPC takes
    # Format: <priority>;<goal_type>;<parameters>
    - "0;float"
    - "1;melee_attack;0.25;true"
    - "2;random_stroll;0.2;80;false"
    - "3;look_at_players;8;100"
    - "4;random_look_around"
  
  targets:
    # Targets define what the NPC attacks
